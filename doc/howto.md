* How to Use the Ntuplizer

** Run the Ntuplizer

Open the `macros/runNTGJ.C` in an editor.

First ignore the first six lines of Bash preamble wrapped within an `#if 0` and `#endif`. This allows the macro to be executed like a shell script (see below), while being legitimate C++ code.

The `NULL`-terminated `const char *package[]` enumerates the packages needed for the execution. They have to be legitimate packages on the CVMFS and Grid (not from a local `aliBuild`). If this macro is executed in a local `aliBuild` environment, this versions will be replaced to make sure the initial compilation of the ntuplizer succeeds.

Next, go to `plugin->SetAliROOTVersion()` and `plugin->SetAliPhysicsVersion()` and set them to valid versions.

Several `-1`-terminated run lists like `const int run_number_lhc15o[]` are defined. They are separately named to facilitate the storage of multiple periods in this macro. Then, after an appropriate `plugin->SetGridDataDir()` and `plugin->SetDataPattern()`, a `const int *run_number` points to the correct one.

Finally, there is a section that fixes the current practice of the output storage element being unpredictable instead of honoring `alien_CLOSE_SE`.

Then execute the Grid job as:

```bash
./macros/runNTGJ.C test
```

or:

```bash
./macros/runNTGJ.C full
```

The macro will automatically execute e.g. `root -l -b -q ./macros/runNTGJ.C("full")`.

* Run the Ntuple Merger

Do not attempt to merge ntuples on the Grid. They will inevitably fail as ALICE always call `hadd` to merge, which is in-memory. Instead, another macro is provided for disk-resident merging. For example, to merge `rx/lhc16h2a_bis-246994-1/001/AnalysisResults.root`, `rx/lhc16h2a_bis-246994-1/002/AnalysisResults.root`, etc., execute:

```bash
./macros/MergeNtuple.C "rx/lhc16h2a_bis-246994-1/*/*.root" merged_output.root
```

Note to quote the wildcard. The wildcard is expanded via shell, and is not limited to ROOT&rsquo;s expansion (which does not allow multiple directories).
